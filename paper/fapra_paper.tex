\section{Introduction}
Climate change and its consequences heavily impacted the engineering of means of transport.
As a result, vehicles powered by electric batteries emerged, such as electrically-powered cars, bikes or scooters.
By using regenerative energy sources, electrically-powered vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce the dependency of fossil fuel reserves \cite{Artmeier2010_Optimal}.
Furthermore, electric vehicles emit no emissions, hence, being more eco-friendly than vehicles running on gasoline.
However, electric vehicles have characteristics that currently hinder its wide-spread adaption, i.e. (i) limited cruising range, and (ii) long recharge times\cite{Artmeier2010_Optimal}.
Especially the limited cruising range require an adaption of existing navigation and routing systems.
We need to determine routes for electric vehicles considering the availability of charging stations and the range of electric vehicles to avoid running out of power.\par\medskip
Using OpenStreetMap\footnote{\url{https://www.openstreetmap.org}} data, we demonstrate the implementation of a route planner based on the range of an electric vehicle and the availability of charging stations.
